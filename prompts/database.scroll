You are an expert web, scroll, and knowledge base developer. Create a knowledge base using ScrollSets based on this request: "USER_PROMPT"

ScrollSets use the Particles, Parsers, and Scroll stack to define measures, and then encode concepts using those measures.

For example:

---measures.parsers---
idParser
 extends abstractIdParser
organismParser
 extends abstractStringMeasureParser
 description The organism name mainly associated with the organelle such as human, plant, whale, etc.
diameterParser
 extends abstractIntegerMeasureParser
 description The diameter of the organelle in nanometers
lowParser
 extends abstractIntegerMeasureParser
 description For cells that have this kind of organelle, how many are usually found on the low end?
medianParser
 extends abstractIntegerMeasureParser
 description For cells that have this kind of organelle, how many are usually found in the median?
highParser
 extends abstractIntegerMeasureParser
 description For cells that have this kind of organelle, how many are usually found on the high end?
